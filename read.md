#Polar chart

##Built with
D3.js
Vue.js

##Next steps: 
1. Cleaning the current code in Vue.js (methods for adjusting the heights of the bars to be more DRY);
1. Adjusting the names of dimensions via dashboard with Vue.js;
2. Selecting color seperately for each bar;
3. Flexible number of bars & button to add new ones (with Vue templates);
4. 'Save' button in PDF/SVG/PNG;

5. Online responsiveness (unlike version for print - less responsive):
  - size of svg for each screen;
  - font size;

6. Adding 'Muli' to JS as base64 string;
7. Centering labels;
8. Reversing the labels upside-down?
