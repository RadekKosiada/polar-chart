#Polar chart

##Built with
D3.js
Vue.js

##Next steps: 
1. Adding inputs in Vue.js or React.js to adjust the heights of the bars;
2. Selecting color seperately for each bar;
3. Flexible number of bars & button to add new ones;
4. 'Save' button in PDF/SVG/PNG;

5. Online responsive (unlike version for print - less responsive):
  - size of svg for each screen;
  - font size;

6. Adding font to JS as base64 string;
7. Centering labels;
8. Reversing the labels upside-down?
